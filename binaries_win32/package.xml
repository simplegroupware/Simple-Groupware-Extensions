Most hosting companies use Debian on their servers, but they don't install packages like catdoc, xpdf or unzip.
Also sometimes the packages are installed, but the webpage is running in a chroot environment which forbids to execute these binaries.
Using this option, you can directly use Debian binaries included in the Simple Groupware packages.

Contents:
catdoc
convert (ImageMagick)
exiv2
graphviz
gzip
mp3info
pdfinfo
pdftotext
ppthtml
tar
unzip
xls2csv

Note: These packages may not be the latest versions, so you should only use them in combination with a virus scanner.
